Multiplay
=========

I took the [Pointerlock example](https://plus.google.com/+RicardoCabello/posts/L3uVi8w6pie) from [mrdoob](http://mrdoob.com/) (the creator of the famous [three.js](http://threejs.org) JavaScript library) and created a small prototype to showcase multiplayer and multiple viewport capabilities.

I included the node_modules and the js on purpose so that it should be possible to start it without downloading packages.

Installation
============

You need [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

If you are lucky, you can download the zip or clone the repo, enter the folder and execute `node server`. The you should be able to see a page on `http://localhost:8000`.

If that doesn't work you will want to download the modules with `npm install`.
